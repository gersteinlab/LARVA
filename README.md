LARVA
=====

We have developed a computational framework for identifying rare germline variants types of recurrent variation, named Large-scale Analysis of Recurrent Variants and Annotations (LARVA). Given a set of cancer patient whole genome variant calls, and a set of genome annotations, LARVA will pick out the recurrent variants and recurrently mutated annotations that result from overlapping the variants with the annotations.
